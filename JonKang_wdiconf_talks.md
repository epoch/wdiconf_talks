# Tracking the impact of projects in communities abroad through funding of water and food products
- I will be talking about the tech used to track projects that provide clean running water, clean food, sanitation (and much more) to communities abroad who don't have access to these basics
- Examples of companies who do this are:   
  [Thankyou Co](https://thankyou.co/projects/)   
  [Charity: Water](https://www.charitywater.org/our-projects/completed-projects/)
- Hopefully 5 minutes (with a demonstration)
